# RGB-D IoT Small-Object Segmentation

This repository contains the official implementation and experimental artifacts for an IoT-grade RGB and depth (RGB-D) small-object segmentation framework designed for indoor environments. The work focuses on robust multimodal perception under realistic sensing conditions, including low-light RGB, missing or noisy depth, and cross-modal misalignment.
